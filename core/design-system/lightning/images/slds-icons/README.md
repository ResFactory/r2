# Salesforce Lighting Design System (SLDS) Icons

The icons in this directory were downloaded from
[lightningdesignsystem.com](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/) on
June 22, 2021. We only use the sprites and not all the individual `*.png` and
`*.svg` files so this is a partial directory.

## TODO

- Figure out how to put these up on a CDN or GitHub so that they are not
  required in publications.
- There was an issue of SVG security not allowing the SVG use element not
  allowing cross-origin href?
