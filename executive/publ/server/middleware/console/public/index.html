                        ## Essential

                        * Switch from github.com/dyedgreen/deno-sqlite to https://github.com/denodrivers/sqlite3 for better performance
                        * Remove `/console` "hardcoding" from each file (have `path.actuate.js` register its "mount point" in each directory)
                        * Implement restart server handler using new user agent bus (UAB) infrastructure
                        * Implement dynamic navigation using `path.ctx.js`. This might work like Deno's `mod.ts` does where
                        we inventory the files in the current path. If it's regular enough, it could be auto-generated on
                        each start of the server or through Taskfile.ts.

                            ```js
                            const pathCtx = {
                                parent: import('../path.ctx.js'), // if it doesn't exist, parent would be undefined (not error?)
                                entries: [
                                    { unit: "x.html" }, // should have just enough for runtime parsing to be possible
                                    { unit: "y.html" }, // follows interface defined for RouteUnit, which is inherited by RouteNode
                                ],
                            };
                            export default pathCtx;
                            ```

                        * Continuously run Lighthouse in Edge/Chrome DevTools to make sure performance is maintained.

                        ## Next

                        * Migrate all legacy `control-panel` pages to rfConsole.
                        * Integrate Deno-specific [Packup](https://github.com/kt3k/packup) packager as Oak routes or use it
                        as guidance.
                        * In `executive/publ/console/mod.ts` make `#isAccessLoggingEnabled` accessible through Console so
                        access logging can be controlled from the browser dynamically.
                        * Create feature flags API endpoint so that unlimited Unleash-like FF's can be integrated
                        * Implement [Oak eTag](https://github.com/oakserver/oak#etag-support) before going to production
                        * Implement [effector.dev](https://effector.dev/) for business logic (with XState for mor complex requirements)

                        ## Components

                        * Check out [Minze](https://minze.dev/guide/introduction.html), Atomico, Tonic, and other lightweight CE frameworks to create our own library and conventions. It's best to not use other frameworks as dependencies.
                        * Use [µhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml#readme) for DOM-friendly dynamic rendering.
                        * Use [µce](https://github.com/WebReflection/uce) for µhtml-based Custom Elements.
                        * Use [µce\-template](https://github.com/WebReflection/uce-template#readme) for a Vue 3 inspired Custom Elements toolless alternative.

                        ## Experiment

                        * See [Building data\-centric apps with a reactive relational database](https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/) for interesting way to use SQLite.

                        ## From README.md

                        ### Framework

                        - Consider replacing or augmenting `shah/ts-safety` with [garronej/tsafe](https://github.com/garronej/tsafe)
                        because it has more capabilities for ensuring type safety. `tsafe` can be used
                        with AJV to validate frontmatter and models at compile time and runtime.
                        - Allow certain Deno modules to flag themselves for automatic SSR through
                        serverless services. We can use something like `module.ssrs.rf.ts` to indicate
                        that a route like `/module` gets created and that route proxies everything to
                        that "SSR service" (`ssrs`). [Overlord](https://github.com/KhaledSakr/overlord)
                        is a good example of that capability.
                        - Integrate [command palette for the web](https://github.com/benwinding/command-pal) for easier navigation of directives, searching, etc.
                        - Incorporate [Pandoc Markdown CSS Theme](https://jez.io/pandoc-markdown-css-theme/)
                        [Tufte Pandoc CSS](https://github.com/jez/tufte-pandoc-css), and [notion.css](https://sreeram-venkitesh.github.io/notion.css/)
                        as alternate Markdown layouts. Allow Markdown author to choose their layout using
                        `.resFactory` directives.
                        - Use [deno-ci](https://github.com/justjavac/deno-ci) to store traceability data
                        in observability diagnostics to indicate whether build was done in CI/CD
                        environment.
                        - Incorporate [polyglot-tag](https://github.com/rpaterson/polyglot-tag) approach
                        in renderers and design systems (e.g. partials, pages, etc.) so that arbitrary
                        languages can be called and assembled.
                        - Incorporate [Design decisions](https://prpl.dev/design-decisions) into docs.
                        - How can web workers improve rendering performance?
                        - Use
                        [Deno Deploy or PgDCP for Serverless Functions as
                        Proxies](https://css-tricks.com/serverless-functions-as-proxies/)
                        - Integrate [Plausible](https://github.com/plausible/analytics),
                        [Fathom](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom) or custom analytics framework
                        plus add type-safe Google Analytics into Design System base classes.
                        - For tracking click throughs integrate with Funnelytics.io,
                            [BPMN Engine](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-engine) or similar.
                        - Review
                            [server\-side conversion tracking](https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-is-server-side-conversion-tracking/)
                            to see how we might be able to use routes, aliases, etc. to manage tracking
                            and then we can integrate with innovators, suppliers, etc. and our
                            publications.
                        - Integrate [denodash](https://github.com/brianboyko/denodash) for refinery
                        calls, enhancing EventEmitter, finding nodes in a tree, and a variety of other
                        useful functional programming uses.
                        - Integrate
                        [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/)
                        - Evaluate [Snel](https://github.com/crewdevio/Snel) for Svelte integration
                        - [Marko](https://markojs.com/) is a similar idea but only supports NPM
                        - Evaluate [xstate](https://cdn.skypack.dev/xstate) to incorporate FSMs where
                        appropriate.
                        - Check out [PHP-based Grav](https://getgrav.org/features) for some great ideas
                        such as aggressive caching, package manager, multi-site capabilities, custom
                        page headers, automatic Page Link Handling, dynamic image manipulation and
                        documentation.

                        ### Bunders and Builders

                        - Allow poly-build capability using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/),
                        [Rome](https://rome.tools/), and other bundlers and builders. This space is
                        very active and we should not reinvent the wheel.

                        ### Context

                        - Add `Partial<govn.RenderContextSupplier<*Context>>` to HtmlLayout, JsonLayout,
                        etc so that pages, partials, etc. can easily see which "environment" like
                        production, sandbox, devl, test, etc. they are running in.
                        - This is especially helpful to show banners across the top/bottom of sites in
                            dev/test/sandbox environments for clarity.
                        - Allow contexts to be carried into ClientCargo so generated web assets can
                            use `location.hostname` as a way of indicating devl/sandbox/prod contexts.

                        ### Models

                        - Use [Ajv JSON schema validator](https://ajv.js.org/) to validate models since
                        need to be type-safe but fully extensible across resources.
                        - Decide how much alignment or separation there should be between frontmatter
                        and models. Should frontmatter and models be the same or is there room for
                        both? For example, frontmatter might be schema-free but models are type-safe?

                        ### Redirects

                        - Implement special link shortener and asset trackingredirects for web assets.
                        This would allow `domain.com/x/ABC` type definitions to allow automatic
                        generation of redirects tied to shortcode (`ABC`). Also, it would allow easy
                        implementation of [Scarf Gateway](https://about.scarf.sh/scarf-gateway) style
                        resource tracking (see related [Nomia](https://github.com/scarf-sh/nomia/)
                        project for universal resource namespaces).

                        ### Visualization

                        - [Livemark](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/livemark) is a static page
                        generator that extends Markdown with interactive charts, tables, scripts, and
                        more. Should be a good comparable for us to incorporate into Factory.

                        ### Database Functionality

                        - [Evidence](https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence) enables analysts to
                        deliver a polished business intelligence system using SQL and markdown. This
                        is a great approach that we should integrate.
                        [Hacker News Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28304781).
                        - Use [Rakam](https://rakam.io/) as a guide to define our data as code and
                        enable our analytics teams to get insights from your data without SQL. Check
                        out [metriql](https://metriql.com/) as a way to integrate Metrics across
                        databases - as a PgDCP source/sink.

                        ### Unit tests using Resource Factory's documentation

                        - Implement URL fetch originator that can pull in Markdown files like README.md
                        from any source. We can then demo how we can integrate, for example, the
                        design-system/README.md directly into an Resource Factory generated site. This
                        way Markdown can be kept anywhere and included through URLs directly into
                        publications.
                        - Review [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/getting-started), Hugo, Lume, and
                        other SSG documentation to craft our unit tests. The most advanced
                        functionality should come from our own documentation. This means creating data
                        in SQLite to mimic DB behavior.

                        ### Frontmatter

                        - [HUGE, a Hugo framework](https://www.thenewdynamic.com/article/introducing-huge-a-hugo-framework/)
                        seems to have some good idea about how to use Frontmatter in Markdown to drive
                        some interesting behaviors.
                        - Unify frontmatter and model in resources so that FM is more about unstructured
                        data while model is structured and type-safe
                        - Use
                        [Superstruct Describing Types](https://docs.superstructjs.org/guides/06-using-typescript#describing-types)
                        feature to create a frontmatter guard-based "typer" that allows untyped
                        frontmatter to be turned into a typed structure consumable by resources.
                        - Use this for RouteSupplier route unit declarations that will be used to
                            build RouteTree nodes
                        - Use this for LayoutSupplier declarations
                        - Consider [Ajv JSON schema validator](https://ajv.js.org/) for validating
                            frontmatter in JS instead of just TypeScript.

                        ### Images

                        - Check out [imgIX](https://docs.imgix.com/setup/serving-images) for either
                        direct integration or guidance to build our own Deno Deploy-based serverless
                        services for similar capabilities.

                        ### Originators

                        ### Refinery Middleware

                        ### Type-safety

                        ### Lint

                        - When building clean after `deno-clear-caches`, getting
                        `Warning Implicitly using latest version (v1.0) for https://deno.land/x/hierarkey/mod.ts`
                        from one of the libraries. Need to figure out which one and pin it to a
                        specific version (see SSCD notes).
