    ## Essential (notes)

    * Integrate [command palette for the web](https://github.com/benwinding/command-pal) or [ninja-keys](https://github.com/ssleptsov/ninja-keys) for easier navigation of directives, searching, etc.
      [Boop](https://github.com/IvanMathy/Boop) is a good example of functionality we can incorporate by running scripts from JS or SQL inventories.
    * cloudquery.io SQL remote proxy to allow easy access to Cloud resources through SQL.
    * Integrate [HyperFormula](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/) for post-SQL snippts and srScript transformations
    * Use `/// <reference types="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/effector/effector/master/packages/effector/index.d.ts" />` with
      `import * as eff from "https://unpkg.com/effector@22.3.0/effector.mjs"` to get proper typing of Effector in Deno.
    * Use `JsRealm` API in [Deno 1.21](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.21.0) to help isolate server runtime script executions for security.
    * Allow Git updates through rfExplorer by running Taskfile.ts or VS Code tasks?
    * Add `Taskfile.ts` execution, especially for bundling
      - show bundling status in rfExplorer (which files are newer than their `*.auto.js` counterparts)
      - show dependency graphs for `*.auto.js` counterparts
      - perform auto-bundling through rfExplorer
    * Accelerate native Windows support to make it easier for non-engineers to use RF.
      - Migrate away from `Justfile` to `Taskfile.ts` so we can remain platform-neutral.
      - Since we have a robust dev mode server we can move away from symlinks and other Linux-specific functionality so
    that the rfExplorer-based sites can be run on Windows with WSL.
        - We use symlinks to prevent all assets/graphics being being _copied_ during builds (for performance); with rfExplorer
          the server can automatically "mount" asset endpoints and automatically coordinate asset locations.
      - We can move away from .envrc and other environment-specific functionality to TypeScript and SQLite-based configuration
      - Move away from `Justfile` and any other external utilities to pure Deno/TS/JS integrated into RF `lib`
    * Move most (if not all) `.envrc` configuration into `*.ts` files using SQLite store
    (on each start of `pubctl.ts` import records `*.ts` to SQLite). This will allow us to
    be platform-neutral and remove data entry errors in `.envrc`. Treat what's in `.envrc`
    as "seed data" to SQLite not environment data necessarily.
    * Move all functionality from `core/design-system/lightning/layout/partial/diagnostics.ts` into rfExplorer (for performance and safety).
    * Switch from github.com/dyedgreen/deno-sqlite to https://github.com/denodrivers/sqlite3 for better performance
    * Implement dynamic navigation using `path.ctx.js`. This might work like Deno's `mod.ts` does where
    we inventory the files in the current path. If it's regular enough, it could be auto-generated on
    each start of the server or through Taskfile.ts.

        ```js
        const pathCtx = {
            parent: import('../path.ctx.js'), // if it doesn't exist, parent would be undefined (not error?)
            entries: [
                { unit: "x.html" }, // should have just enough for runtime parsing to be possible
                { unit: "y.html" }, // follows interface defined for RouteUnit, which is inherited by RouteNode
            ],
        };
        export default pathCtx;
        ```
    * Continuously run Lighthouse in Edge/Chrome DevTools to make sure performance is maintained. This is not
    necessarily for rfExplorer but because we're experimenting with HTML+JS(lightweight) to see if we can get
    enough performance from client-side rendering (instead of only SSR).

    ## Next

    * Surface `lib/sql/rdbms-schema-ts.ts` as an RF Originator so that those can be consumed as Resources and
      generate code as part of production process. (see `telosys.org` code generator as inspiration).
    * Surface SQL snippets and JS runtime scripts' inventories as Originators so that they can be considered
      Resources and used in production process.
    * Think about whether we want both an rfConsole for managing server and rfExplorer for inspections?
    * Add `publ_server_access_log` table along side `publ_server_static_access_log` to see if we're seeing `404`s, etc.
    * Learn from https://github.com/koskimas/kysely#deno about how to make our SQLite integration friendlier.
    * Integrate [docsql](https://github.com/peterbe/docsql) functionality into rfExplorer.
    * Migrate `metrics.json` to SQLite.
    * Migrate all legacy `control-panel` pages to rfExplorer.
    * Generate https://github.com/koskimas/kysely from SQLite schema for TS-based queries.
    * Integrate Deno-specific [Packup](https://github.com/kt3k/packup) packager as Oak routes or use it
    as guidance.
    * Create feature flags API endpoint so that unlimited Unleash-like FF's can be integrated
    * Implement [Oak eTag](https://github.com/oakserver/oak#etag-support) before going to production
    * Use [deku](https://github.com/yisar/deku/blob/master/src/server.ts) hot module reloading (HMR) as rfExplorer websocket-based HMR strategy.

    ## Route and file system path-specific configuration

    - See [The Ultimate Guide to Hugo Sections](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-hugo-sections/)
    to eliminate `_index.md` and replace with `path.ts` or `path.js.ts` or similar.
    - Use [astring](https://www.skypack.dev/view/astring) JavaScript code generator
    by building ESTree-compliant ASTs for JavaScript-based routes and other
    artifacts. For example, we can create a `routes.js` which would be similar to
    `routes.json` except in JavaScript instead of JSON. By including JavaScript
    instead of JSON we can have easier use within HTML files and be able to catch
    reference errors when structures change.
    - Similar to functionality in NEFS Sparx which generated type-safe code for
        custom sites.
    - Also, we could consider generating TypeScript by adding some typing on top
        of the generated JS. Similar to how
        [GSD](https://github.com/gov-suite/governed-structured-data) operates; or,
        we could just use GSD out of the box?
    - Implement `.Resource Factory.ts` type-safe _profiles_ which will include all
    extensions and supply configurations such as `layout` and other rules. Instead
    of forcing all rules in a common configuration, allow `.Resource Factory.ts`
    at any route to override any configuration value by merging properties with
    ancestors. This will be referred to as the Resource Factory _Route Profile_ or
    _Resource Profile_.

    ## Routes and Trees

    - Introduce namespaces into routes so they can indicate where they fit into
    multiple systems (e.g. more than one statically generate site or multiple
    projects that can be built without each others' knowledge).
    - [Nomia](https://github.com/scarf-sh/nomia/) is an interesting project for
        universal resource namespaces and might be worth integrating.
    - Incorporate https://deno.land/x/urlcat for type-safe URLs in Routes
    - Implement route computation using
    [path-to-regexp.compile()](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/blob/master/src/index.ts#L252)
    - Check out https://web.dev/urlpattern/ for additional ideas
    - Check out https://www.skypack.dev/view/regexparam which is much smaller
        could potentially be incorporated directly without becoming a source
        dependency.
    - Read Astro's
    [File\-based routing, inspired by
    Next\.js](https://astro.build/blog/astro-019#file-based-routing-inspired-by-nextjs)
    article to understand how routing is defined by Next.js SvelteKit to allow
    similar patterns to be passed into originators and resource constructors.
    - Consider generating UUIDv4 identities for each resource's body content so that
    body content can be "fingerprinted" for caching and testing for changes
    without using a revision control system. This will allow resources to be
    portable across publications.
    - Consider generating UUIDv4 identities for each route tree node so that the
    same route from any partial sites will generate the same ID. This will allow
    routes to know when they have been "moved".
    - Implement aliasing so that parsed routes can indicate that they "belong" to a
    different parent than their physical location. These are almost like parent
    aliases.
    - Consider allowing setting `parents` so that the same resource could insert
        itself into multiple parents. Instead of being an alias, the same resource
        could be in two routes.
    - This capability might allow better partial routes which would allow a child
        to insert itself to a parent route, if it existed, and ignore if it did not
        exist.
    - Allow directories to become routes without necessarily tying it to a resource
    - Should directories themselves become originators (resource factories)?
    - Implement [related content](https://gohugo.io/content-management/related/)
    similar to the way Hugo and other SSGs work. In our case, we can allow dynamic
    relationships with Frontmatter (untyped) or Models (type-safe).

    ## Components

    * Check out [Minze](https://minze.dev/guide/introduction.html), Atomico, Tonic, and other lightweight CE frameworks to create our own library and conventions. It's best to not use other frameworks as dependencies.
    * Use [µhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml#readme) for DOM-friendly dynamic rendering.
    * Use [µce](https://github.com/WebReflection/uce) for µhtml-based Custom Elements.
    * Use [µce\-template](https://github.com/WebReflection/uce-template#readme) for a Vue 3 inspired Custom Elements toolless alternative.

    ## Experiment

    * See [Building data\-centric apps with a reactive relational database](https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/) for interesting way to use SQLite.
    * See [The Future of Work is Not Corporate — It’s DAOs and Crypto Networks](https://future.a16z.com/the-future-of-work-daos-crypto-networks/) and [How to create a DAO](https://blog.logrocket.com/create-dao-next-js-thirdweb/) to incorporate DAO management features into RF.

    ## Framework

    - Consider using https://github.com/devops-works/binenv for `$RF_HOME/lib/sql/shell/bin` and other binaries
    - Consider replacing or augmenting `shah/ts-safety` with [garronej/tsafe](https://github.com/garronej/tsafe)
    because it has more capabilities for ensuring type safety. `tsafe` can be used
    with AJV to validate frontmatter and models at compile time and runtime.
    - Allow certain Deno modules to flag themselves for automatic SSR through
    serverless services. We can use something like `module.ssrs.rf.ts` to indicate
    that a route like `/module` gets created and that route proxies everything to
    that "SSR service" (`ssrs`). [Overlord](https://github.com/KhaledSakr/overlord)
    is a good example of that capability.
    - Incorporate [Pandoc Markdown CSS Theme](https://jez.io/pandoc-markdown-css-theme/)
    [Tufte Pandoc CSS](https://github.com/jez/tufte-pandoc-css), and [notion.css](https://sreeram-venkitesh.github.io/notion.css/)
    as alternate Markdown layouts. Allow Markdown author to choose their layout using
    `.resFactory` directives.
    - Use [deno-ci](https://github.com/justjavac/deno-ci) to store traceability data
    in observability diagnostics to indicate whether build was done in CI/CD
    environment.
    - Incorporate [polyglot-tag](https://github.com/rpaterson/polyglot-tag) approach
    in renderers and design systems (e.g. partials, pages, etc.) so that arbitrary
    languages can be called and assembled.
    - Incorporate [Design decisions](https://prpl.dev/design-decisions) into docs.
    - How can web workers improve rendering performance?
    - Use
    [Deno Deploy or PgDCP for Serverless Functions as
    Proxies](https://css-tricks.com/serverless-functions-as-proxies/)
    - Integrate [Plausible](https://github.com/plausible/analytics),
    [Fathom](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom) or custom analytics framework
    plus add type-safe Google Analytics into Design System base classes.
    - For tracking click throughs integrate with Funnelytics.io,
        [BPMN Engine](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-engine) or similar.
    - Review
        [server\-side conversion tracking](https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-is-server-side-conversion-tracking/)
        to see how we might be able to use routes, aliases, etc. to manage tracking
        and then we can integrate with innovators, suppliers, etc. and our
        publications.
    - Integrate [denodash](https://github.com/brianboyko/denodash) for refinery
    calls, enhancing EventEmitter, finding nodes in a tree, and a variety of other
    useful functional programming uses.
    - Integrate
    [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/)
    - Evaluate [Snel](https://github.com/crewdevio/Snel) for Svelte integration
    - [Marko](https://markojs.com/) is a similar idea but only supports NPM
    - Evaluate [xstate](https://cdn.skypack.dev/xstate) to incorporate FSMs where
    appropriate.
    - Check out [PHP-based Grav](https://getgrav.org/features) for some great ideas
    such as aggressive caching, package manager, multi-site capabilities, custom
    page headers, automatic Page Link Handling, dynamic image manipulation and
    documentation.

    ## Bundlers and Builders

    - Enhance CSS/TS twins capability and integrate https://deno.land/x/denosass generator.
    - Add https://purgecss.com/ and other PostCSS plugins into CSS/TS twins strategy.

    ## Context

    - Add `Partial<govn.RenderContextSupplier<*Context>>` to HtmlLayout, JsonLayout,
    etc so that pages, partials, etc. can easily see which "environment" like
    production, sandbox, devl, test, etc. they are running in.
    - This is especially helpful to show banners across the top/bottom of sites in
        dev/test/sandbox environments for clarity.
    - Allow contexts to be carried into ClientCargo so generated web assets can
        use `location.hostname` as a way of indicating devl/sandbox/prod contexts.

    ## Models

    - Use [Ajv JSON schema validator](https://ajv.js.org/) to validate models since
    need to be type-safe but fully extensible across resources.
    - Decide how much alignment or separation there should be between frontmatter
    and models. Should frontmatter and models be the same or is there room for
    both? For example, frontmatter might be schema-free but models are type-safe?

    ## Redirects

    - Implement special link shortener and asset trackingredirects for web assets.
    This would allow `domain.com/x/ABC` type definitions to allow automatic
    generation of redirects tied to shortcode (`ABC`). Also, it would allow easy
    implementation of [Scarf Gateway](https://about.scarf.sh/scarf-gateway) style
    resource tracking (see related [Nomia](https://github.com/scarf-sh/nomia/)
    project for universal resource namespaces).

    ## Visualization

    - [Livemark](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/livemark) is a static page
    generator that extends Markdown with interactive charts, tables, scripts, and
    more. Should be a good comparable for us to incorporate into Factory.

    ## Database Functionality

    - Upgrade to https://github.com/porsager/postgres driver for performance.
    - [Evidence](https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence) enables analysts to
    deliver a polished business intelligence system using SQL and markdown. This
    is a great approach that we should integrate.
    [Hacker News Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28304781).
    - Use [Rakam](https://rakam.io/) as a guide to define our data as code and
    enable our analytics teams to get insights from your data without SQL. Check
    out [metriql](https://metriql.com/) as a way to integrate Metrics across
    databases - as a PgDCP source/sink.
    - Use techniques like [this](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/run-a-single-command-on-multiple-linux-machines/amp/)
    to run SQL proxies like `osqueryi` across mutliple machines and collect results.
    We could treat any SQL proxy as multi-machine executable through SSH.

    ## Unit tests using Resource Factory's documentation

    - Implement URL fetch originator that can pull in Markdown files like README.md
    from any source. We can then demo how we can integrate, for example, the
    design-system/README.md directly into an Resource Factory generated site. This
    way Markdown can be kept anywhere and included through URLs directly into
    publications.
    - Review [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/getting-started), Hugo, Lume, and
    other SSG documentation to craft our unit tests. The most advanced
    functionality should come from our own documentation. This means creating data
    in SQLite to mimic DB behavior.

    ## Frontmatter

    - [HUGE, a Hugo framework](https://www.thenewdynamic.com/article/introducing-huge-a-hugo-framework/)
    seems to have some good idea about how to use Frontmatter in Markdown to drive
    some interesting behaviors.
    - Unify frontmatter and model in resources so that FM is more about unstructured
    data while model is structured and type-safe
    - Use
    [Superstruct Describing Types](https://docs.superstructjs.org/guides/06-using-typescript#describing-types)
    feature to create a frontmatter guard-based "typer" that allows untyped
    frontmatter to be turned into a typed structure consumable by resources.
    - Use this for RouteSupplier route unit declarations that will be used to
        build RouteTree nodes
    - Use this for LayoutSupplier declarations
    - Consider [Ajv JSON schema validator](https://ajv.js.org/) for validating
        frontmatter in JS instead of just TypeScript.

    ## Images

    - Check out [imgIX](https://docs.imgix.com/setup/serving-images) for either
    direct integration or guidance to build our own Deno Deploy-based serverless
    services for similar capabilities.

    ## Originators

    ## Refinery Middleware

    ## Type-safety

    - See [Documenting your Express API with Swagger](https://blog.logrocket.com/documenting-your-express-api-with-swagger/) for ideas for how to generate Swagger/OpenAPI documents from within our routes.

    ## Data Privacy

    - Use strategy outlined in https://github.com/higgins/privatize to create `privacy` directive to allow symmetric encryption of portions of content.

    ## Content naming conventions

    - `name.m1.m2.ts` is used for TypeScript-based content with `m1` and `m2` as
    _modifiers_. Examples include:
    - `name.rf.ts` signifies with `.rf.` _modifier_ that this TypeScript module
        generates one or more _resources_ of _arbitrary nature_ (e.g. mixed HTML,
        JSON, etc.).
    - `name.html.ts` signifies with `.html` is that this module produces HTML.
    - `name.json.ts` signifies with `.json` is that this module produces JSON.
    - `name.ssrs.rf.ts` signifies that this is a Deno Deploy or similar server-
        side rendering service (SSRS)

    ## Software Supply Chain and Dependencies (SSCD)

    - Always pin imports to semver versioned imports and references (_never_ use
    unversioned imports)
    - Put production dependencies in `deps.ts` and test dependencies in
    `deps-test.ts`.

    ## Maintenance

    - Regularly run `repo-task update-deno-deps` at the top level of this library. That command runs a target in `Taskfile.ts` which helps update and maintain dependencies and perform other library-specific maintenance.

    > repo-task update-deno-deps
    > deno-test

    ## Lint

    - When building clean after `deno-clear-caches`, getting
    `Warning Implicitly using latest version (v1.0) for https://deno.land/x/hierarkey/mod.ts`
    from one of the libraries. Need to figure out which one and pin it to a
    specific version (see SSCD notes).
