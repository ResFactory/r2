    ## Essential

    * Switch from github.com/dyedgreen/deno-sqlite to https://github.com/denodrivers/sqlite3 for better performance
    * Implement dynamic navigation using `path.ctx.js`. This might work like Deno's `mod.ts` does where
    we inventory the files in the current path. If it's regular enough, it could be auto-generated on
    each start of the server or through Taskfile.ts.

        ```js
        const pathCtx = {
            parent: import('../path.ctx.js'), // if it doesn't exist, parent would be undefined (not error?)
            entries: [
                { unit: "x.html" }, // should have just enough for runtime parsing to be possible
                { unit: "y.html" }, // follows interface defined for RouteUnit, which is inherited by RouteNode
            ],
        };
        export default pathCtx;
        ```

    * Continuously run Lighthouse in Edge/Chrome DevTools to make sure performance is maintained. This is not
    necessarily for rfExplorer but because we're experimenting with HTML+JS(lightweight) to see if we can get
    enough performance from client-side rendering (instead of only SSR).

    ## Next

    * Migrate `metrics.json` to SQLite.
    * Migrate all legacy `control-panel` pages to rfExplorer.
    * Integrate Deno-specific [Packup](https://github.com/kt3k/packup) packager as Oak routes or use it
    as guidance.
    * Create feature flags API endpoint so that unlimited Unleash-like FF's can be integrated
    * Implement [Oak eTag](https://github.com/oakserver/oak#etag-support) before going to production

    ## Components

    * Check out [Minze](https://minze.dev/guide/introduction.html), Atomico, Tonic, and other lightweight CE frameworks to create our own library and conventions. It's best to not use other frameworks as dependencies.
    * Use [µhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml#readme) for DOM-friendly dynamic rendering.
    * Use [µce](https://github.com/WebReflection/uce) for µhtml-based Custom Elements.
    * Use [µce\-template](https://github.com/WebReflection/uce-template#readme) for a Vue 3 inspired Custom Elements toolless alternative.

    ## Experiment

    * See [Building data\-centric apps with a reactive relational database](https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/) for interesting way to use SQLite.

    ## Framework

    - Consider replacing or augmenting `shah/ts-safety` with [garronej/tsafe](https://github.com/garronej/tsafe)
    because it has more capabilities for ensuring type safety. `tsafe` can be used
    with AJV to validate frontmatter and models at compile time and runtime.
    - Allow certain Deno modules to flag themselves for automatic SSR through
    serverless services. We can use something like `module.ssrs.rf.ts` to indicate
    that a route like `/module` gets created and that route proxies everything to
    that "SSR service" (`ssrs`). [Overlord](https://github.com/KhaledSakr/overlord)
    is a good example of that capability.
    - Integrate [command palette for the web](https://github.com/benwinding/command-pal) for easier navigation of directives, searching, etc.
    - Incorporate [Pandoc Markdown CSS Theme](https://jez.io/pandoc-markdown-css-theme/)
    [Tufte Pandoc CSS](https://github.com/jez/tufte-pandoc-css), and [notion.css](https://sreeram-venkitesh.github.io/notion.css/)
    as alternate Markdown layouts. Allow Markdown author to choose their layout using
    `.resFactory` directives.
    - Use [deno-ci](https://github.com/justjavac/deno-ci) to store traceability data
    in observability diagnostics to indicate whether build was done in CI/CD
    environment.
    - Incorporate [polyglot-tag](https://github.com/rpaterson/polyglot-tag) approach
    in renderers and design systems (e.g. partials, pages, etc.) so that arbitrary
    languages can be called and assembled.
    - Incorporate [Design decisions](https://prpl.dev/design-decisions) into docs.
    - How can web workers improve rendering performance?
    - Use
    [Deno Deploy or PgDCP for Serverless Functions as
    Proxies](https://css-tricks.com/serverless-functions-as-proxies/)
    - Integrate [Plausible](https://github.com/plausible/analytics),
    [Fathom](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom) or custom analytics framework
    plus add type-safe Google Analytics into Design System base classes.
    - For tracking click throughs integrate with Funnelytics.io,
        [BPMN Engine](https://github.com/paed01/bpmn-engine) or similar.
    - Review
        [server\-side conversion tracking](https://digiday.com/marketing/wtf-is-server-side-conversion-tracking/)
        to see how we might be able to use routes, aliases, etc. to manage tracking
        and then we can integrate with innovators, suppliers, etc. and our
        publications.
    - Integrate [denodash](https://github.com/brianboyko/denodash) for refinery
    calls, enhancing EventEmitter, finding nodes in a tree, and a variety of other
    useful functional programming uses.
    - Integrate
    [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/)
    - Evaluate [Snel](https://github.com/crewdevio/Snel) for Svelte integration
    - [Marko](https://markojs.com/) is a similar idea but only supports NPM
    - Evaluate [xstate](https://cdn.skypack.dev/xstate) to incorporate FSMs where
    appropriate.
    - Check out [PHP-based Grav](https://getgrav.org/features) for some great ideas
    such as aggressive caching, package manager, multi-site capabilities, custom
    page headers, automatic Page Link Handling, dynamic image manipulation and
    documentation.

    ## Bunders and Builders

    - Allow poly-build capability using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/),
    [Rome](https://rome.tools/), and other bundlers and builders. This space is
    very active and we should not reinvent the wheel.

    ## Context

    - Add `Partial<govn.RenderContextSupplier<*Context>>` to HtmlLayout, JsonLayout,
    etc so that pages, partials, etc. can easily see which "environment" like
    production, sandbox, devl, test, etc. they are running in.
    - This is especially helpful to show banners across the top/bottom of sites in
        dev/test/sandbox environments for clarity.
    - Allow contexts to be carried into ClientCargo so generated web assets can
        use `location.hostname` as a way of indicating devl/sandbox/prod contexts.

    ## Models

    - Use [Ajv JSON schema validator](https://ajv.js.org/) to validate models since
    need to be type-safe but fully extensible across resources.
    - Decide how much alignment or separation there should be between frontmatter
    and models. Should frontmatter and models be the same or is there room for
    both? For example, frontmatter might be schema-free but models are type-safe?

    ## Redirects

    - Implement special link shortener and asset trackingredirects for web assets.
    This would allow `domain.com/x/ABC` type definitions to allow automatic
    generation of redirects tied to shortcode (`ABC`). Also, it would allow easy
    implementation of [Scarf Gateway](https://about.scarf.sh/scarf-gateway) style
    resource tracking (see related [Nomia](https://github.com/scarf-sh/nomia/)
    project for universal resource namespaces).

    ## Visualization

    - [Livemark](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/livemark) is a static page
    generator that extends Markdown with interactive charts, tables, scripts, and
    more. Should be a good comparable for us to incorporate into Factory.

    ## Database Functionality

    - [Evidence](https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence) enables analysts to
    deliver a polished business intelligence system using SQL and markdown. This
    is a great approach that we should integrate.
    [Hacker News Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28304781).
    - Use [Rakam](https://rakam.io/) as a guide to define our data as code and
    enable our analytics teams to get insights from your data without SQL. Check
    out [metriql](https://metriql.com/) as a way to integrate Metrics across
    databases - as a PgDCP source/sink.

    ## Unit tests using Resource Factory's documentation

    - Implement URL fetch originator that can pull in Markdown files like README.md
    from any source. We can then demo how we can integrate, for example, the
    design-system/README.md directly into an Resource Factory generated site. This
    way Markdown can be kept anywhere and included through URLs directly into
    publications.
    - Review [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/getting-started), Hugo, Lume, and
    other SSG documentation to craft our unit tests. The most advanced
    functionality should come from our own documentation. This means creating data
    in SQLite to mimic DB behavior.

    ## Frontmatter

    - [HUGE, a Hugo framework](https://www.thenewdynamic.com/article/introducing-huge-a-hugo-framework/)
    seems to have some good idea about how to use Frontmatter in Markdown to drive
    some interesting behaviors.
    - Unify frontmatter and model in resources so that FM is more about unstructured
    data while model is structured and type-safe
    - Use
    [Superstruct Describing Types](https://docs.superstructjs.org/guides/06-using-typescript#describing-types)
    feature to create a frontmatter guard-based "typer" that allows untyped
    frontmatter to be turned into a typed structure consumable by resources.
    - Use this for RouteSupplier route unit declarations that will be used to
        build RouteTree nodes
    - Use this for LayoutSupplier declarations
    - Consider [Ajv JSON schema validator](https://ajv.js.org/) for validating
        frontmatter in JS instead of just TypeScript.

    ## Images

    - Check out [imgIX](https://docs.imgix.com/setup/serving-images) for either
    direct integration or guidance to build our own Deno Deploy-based serverless
    services for similar capabilities.

    ## Originators

    ## Refinery Middleware

    ## Type-safety

    ## Content naming conventions

    - `name.m1.m2.ts` is used for TypeScript-based content with `m1` and `m2` as
    _modifiers_. Examples include:
    - `name.rf.ts` signifies with `.rf.` _modifier_ that this TypeScript module
        generates one or more _resources_ of _arbitrary nature_ (e.g. mixed HTML,
        JSON, etc.).
    - `name.html.ts` signifies with `.html` is that this module produces HTML.
    - `name.json.ts` signifies with `.json` is that this module produces JSON.
    - `name.ssrs.rf.ts` signifies that this is a Deno Deploy or similar server-
        side rendering service (SSRS)

    ## Software Supply Chain and Dependencies (SSCD)

    - Always pin imports to semver versioned imports and references (_never_ use
    unversioned imports)
    - Put production dependencies in `deps.ts` and test dependencies in
    `deps-test.ts`.

    ## Maintenance

    - Regularly run `repo-task update-deno-deps` at the top level of this library. That command runs a target in `Taskfile.ts` which helps update and maintain dependencies and perform other library-specific maintenance.

    > repo-task update-deno-deps
    > deno-test

    ## Lint

    - When building clean after `deno-clear-caches`, getting
    `Warning Implicitly using latest version (v1.0) for https://deno.land/x/hierarkey/mod.ts`
    from one of the libraries. Need to figure out which one and pin it to a
    specific version (see SSCD notes).
