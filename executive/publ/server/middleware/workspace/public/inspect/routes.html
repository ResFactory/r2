            ### Route and file system path-specific configuration

            - See [The Ultimate Guide to Hugo Sections](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-hugo-sections/)
            to eliminate `_index.md` and replace with `path.ts` or `path.js.ts` or similar.
            - Use [astring](https://www.skypack.dev/view/astring) JavaScript code generator
            by building ESTree-compliant ASTs for JavaScript-based routes and other
            artifacts. For example, we can create a `routes.js` which would be similar to
            `routes.json` except in JavaScript instead of JSON. By including JavaScript
            instead of JSON we can have easier use within HTML files and be able to catch
            reference errors when structures change.
            - Similar to functionality in NEFS Sparx which generated type-safe code for
                custom sites.
            - Also, we could consider generating TypeScript by adding some typing on top
                of the generated JS. Similar to how
                [GSD](https://github.com/gov-suite/governed-structured-data) operates; or,
                we could just use GSD out of the box?
            - Implement `.Resource Factory.ts` type-safe _profiles_ which will include all
            extensions and supply configurations such as `layout` and other rules. Instead
            of forcing all rules in a common configuration, allow `.Resource Factory.ts`
            at any route to override any configuration value by merging properties with
            ancestors. This will be referred to as the Resource Factory _Route Profile_ or
            _Resource Profile_.

            ### Routes and Trees

            - Introduce namespaces into routes so they can indicate where they fit into
            multiple systems (e.g. more than one statically generate site or multiple
            projects that can be built without each others' knowledge).
            - [Nomia](https://github.com/scarf-sh/nomia/) is an interesting project for
                universal resource namespaces and might be worth integrating.
            - Incorporate https://deno.land/x/urlcat for type-safe URLs in Routes
            - Implement route computation using
            [path-to-regexp.compile()](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/blob/master/src/index.ts#L252)
            - Check out https://web.dev/urlpattern/ for additional ideas
            - Check out https://www.skypack.dev/view/regexparam which is much smaller
                could potentially be incorporated directly without becoming a source
                dependency.
            - Read Astro's
            [File\-based routing, inspired by
            Next\.js](https://astro.build/blog/astro-019#file-based-routing-inspired-by-nextjs)
            article to understand how routing is defined by Next.js SvelteKit to allow
            similar patterns to be passed into originators and resource constructors.
            - Consider generating UUIDv4 identities for each resource's body content so that
            body content can be "fingerprinted" for caching and testing for changes
            without using a revision control system. This will allow resources to be
            portable across publications.
            - Consider generating UUIDv4 identities for each route tree node so that the
            same route from any partial sites will generate the same ID. This will allow
            routes to know when they have been "moved".
            - Implement aliasing so that parsed routes can indicate that they "belong" to a
            different parent than their physical location. These are almost like parent
            aliases.
            - Consider allowing setting `parents` so that the same resource could insert
                itself into multiple parents. Instead of being an alias, the same resource
                could be in two routes.
            - This capability might allow better partial routes which would allow a child
                to insert itself to a parent route, if it existed, and ignore if it did not
                exist.
            - Allow directories to become routes without necessarily tying it to a resource
            - Should directories themselves become originators (resource factories)?
            - Implement [related content](https://gohugo.io/content-management/related/)
            similar to the way Hugo and other SSGs work. In our case, we can allow dynamic
            relationships with Frontmatter (untyped) or Models (type-safe).
