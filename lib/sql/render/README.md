For any modules that leverage SQL for functionality, assembling and loading SQL
in a deterministically reproducible manner is crucial.

This SQL Assembler (SQLa) and SQL rendering library is a Deno TypeScript module
which uses the power of JavaScript Template literals (Template strings) to
create SQL components as building blocks.

Instead of inventing yet another template language, `SQLa` uses a set of naming
conventions plus the full power of JavaScript (and TypeScript) Template strings
to prepare the final SQL that will be loaded into the database.

## TODO

* Incorporate [Evolutionary Database Design](https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html)
  principles into SQL rendering infrastructure.
* See if [Database Change and Version Control for Teams](https://www.bytebase.com/_nuxt/img/main.a176dc4.webp)
  makes sense as a generator target.
* Learn from [DataHub](https://datahubproject.io/docs/features) about how to
  document and manage meta data ('data governance') artifacts and incorporate
  appropriate governance capabilities. These are DataHub features we should
  understand and perhaps push into DataHub:
  * Tracing lineage across platforms, datasets, pipelines, charts, etc.
  * Context about related entities across lineage
  * Capture and maintain institutional knowledge using folksonomic identifiers
    (tags) and taxonomies
  * Asset ownership by users and/or user groups
  * Fine-Grained Access Control with Policies
  * Metadata quality & usage analytics
* Integrate strategies from the following into the code generated by RF:
  * [Lesser Known PostgreSQL Features](https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-unknown-features)
  * [GitLab Migration Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/migration_style_guide.html)
  * [Common DB schema change mistakes](https://postgres.ai/blog/20220525-common-db-schema-change-mistakes#case-1-schema-mismatch)
